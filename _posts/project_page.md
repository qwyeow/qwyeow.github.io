## Fastai deep learning 

[Singapore Rare Birds Classifier](https://github.com/qwyeow/FastAI/blob/master/Singapore_Rare_Birds_Classifier-Prototype.ipynb): a prototype classifier that identifies 10 rare birds seen in Singapore, with close to 90% accuracy, using the techniques from fastai v3 course. Images are downloaded using Google Image Search. The webapp is deployed here [https://sgrarebird-gr0o.app.render.com/](https://sgrarebird-gr0o.app.render.com/). Next we extended the model (82.4% accuracy) to include all 155 rare birds and deployed it [here](https://sgrarebird155.onrender.com)

[102 Flower Species Classifier](https://github.com/qwyeow/FastAI/blob/master/Kaggle_102_Flowers_Diff_Species.ipynb): an image classifier that identifies 102 flower species 3.78% error rate, using Kaggle Dataset



## R-Projects

1. [Interactive map](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/Leaflet_Map): Leaflet showing Michelin Restaurants in Singapore.

2. [Heart Disease Calculator](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/ShinyApps/Heart_Disease_Predictor): Calculates the probability of having Coronary Heart Disease based on five variables. Just change the five slider values and see the probability value changes correspondingly

3. [Next Word Predictor](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/ShinyApps/NextWordPredictor): Type in at least 3 words and this app will predict the next word for you, alongside the scores of each prediction, and the ngram from which the prediction came. 

4. [Tweetbot](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/ShinyApps/Tweetbot): Somehow this tweetbot, a project I created for fun, made it to Prof. Michael Kearney's list of shinyapps that have been shared on twitter.
